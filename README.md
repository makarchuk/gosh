# Shog

Anagram for Gosh (Go Shell)

Simple terminal created for purposes of understanding and getting into go.

Remarks and Advices are highly appreciated

## Roadmap  
- [ ] Smarter stdin (Read by chars, makes it possible to handle tabs and multiline inputs if necessary)
- [ ] History support (I also want to store stdout of command in history, so It will be possible to look it up relatively fast and possibly execution time)
- [ ] Internal commands (most importantly `cd` and `history`)
- [ ] Lookup Paths and search for binaries myself, so I can implement tab-completion
- [ ] Pipes, Custom Stdin/Stdout for programs
